Hello! This is my portfolio website project.


### etc ###
I started out using react typescript just because I like it and have used it a lot in the past.
But because of the simplicity of the website I didn't really need all the functionalities so i did most things with plain html & css.

Anyway, hope you like it and you're free to hit me up with feedback about my code & my website.
